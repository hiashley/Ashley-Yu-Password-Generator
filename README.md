# Password-Generator

## Description
I modified a website to work as a password generator so that it would create a randomized password from a choice of 8-128 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 

## Change Log
- I created different functions and variables under the already existing function: `generatePassword()`.
- A couple things to note: I had to figure out methods we had not gone over in class by researching on my own. Those methods were the following: `Math.floor()`, `Math.random()`, and `join()`.
